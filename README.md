# SPOTIFY-CLONE
The Spotify Clone project is a visually appealing, static web page that replicates the core look and feel of the Spotify interface using only HTML and CSS. This project focuses on recreating Spotify’s dark-themed user interface, including the homepage layout, music player controls, sidebar navigation, and album art sections. Although it doesn’t feature actual functionality for music playback, it’s an excellent project to showcase skills in responsive web design, CSS styling, and layout techniques.

Features:
Homepage Layout: The main page has sections for popular playlists, recommended albums, and top artists, styled to resemble Spotify’s interface.
Sidebar Navigation: A fixed sidebar allows users to “navigate” through different sections such as Home, Search, and Library.
Music Player Controls: At the bottom of the page, a player section includes icons and styling for controls like play, pause, skip, volume, and playback progress.
Dark Theme & Styling: Uses Spotify's signature dark background, along with vibrant green and white accents, making it visually consistent with the actual platform.
Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile views using media queries in CSS.
Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure and layout of the page.
CSS for styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout, custom colors, and animations for interactive elements.
Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with HTML structuring and semantic elements.
Proficiency with CSS for styling complex layouts and responsive design.
Experience with creating visually consistent UI elements like navigation bars, player controls, and grid-based content sections.
This project provides a great opportunity to demonstrate design and layout skills and to build familiarity with CSS techniques used in real-world UI designs.
